## ⚙️ Overview

Unlike traditional trainers, the **FM26 Mod Menu** integrates directly into your matchday and management UI. It adds subtle yet powerful tools like scouting analytics, instant transfer confirmations, and morale optimization scripts.

You can switch between features using a minimalist overlay that appears only when needed — ensuring immersion stays intact.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool doesn’t alter core game files permanently. It uses safe memory injections that reset after each session.
